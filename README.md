# MW1loop
brief code to calculate the W-mass from GF at 1-loop EW

We include a brief bit of code to calculate the W-mass at 1-loop electroweak from the Fermi constant GF.

All the SM input paramters are included and can be modified.

Running the code will iteratively solve the MW-MZ interdependence for MW and print the theoretical 1-loop value.

The only package necessary so far is the complex math package cmath.

We will eventually include the 2-loop QCD corrections.

If using or modifying the code please the cite the appropriate people.
